> a specialized constraint solver for budget flows

<!-- TODO: insert link to website -->

# Overview
Budgeteer allows you to effortlessly balance a budget without doing any monotonous work.  It allows you to intuitively define resource flows and budgeteer will balance it for you.  "Resource" is purposely non-specific here -- you can use this tool to balance a monetary budget, manage your time, track calories, or whatever you want.

Budgeteer is written in TypeScript and relies on [kiwi.js](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/kiwi.js/) to do constraint solving under the hood.

## Disclaimer
Budgeteer is a hobby-tool I built for myself.  I would not advise using it in production.
